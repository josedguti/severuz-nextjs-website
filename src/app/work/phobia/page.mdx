## Overview

This project focused on creating a mobile fitness application that would help users track their workouts, monitor progress, and stay motivated through social features. The client needed a solution that worked seamlessly across both iOS and Android platforms.

We developed a cross-platform mobile app using React Native, ensuring native performance and a smooth user experience on both platforms. The app features an offline-first architecture, allowing users to log workouts even without internet connectivity, with automatic synchronization when back online.

The application integrates with popular wearable devices and health platforms like Apple Health and Google Fit, providing users with comprehensive fitness data in one place. We implemented personalized workout recommendations based on user goals, fitness level, and progress.
