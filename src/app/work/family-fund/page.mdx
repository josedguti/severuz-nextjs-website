## Overview

This project required building a comprehensive e-commerce platform from the ground up. The client needed a solution that could scale with their growing business while providing an excellent user experience for both buyers and sellers.

We designed and implemented a modern web application using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend API. The platform features a sophisticated vendor management system, real-time inventory tracking, integrated payment processing, and automated order fulfillment workflows.

The architecture was built on AWS cloud infrastructure with containerized microservices, allowing for horizontal scaling during high-traffic periods. We implemented CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment, ensuring reliable updates with zero downtime.
