## Overview

This project focused on modernizing a legacy analytics platform that was struggling to handle increasing data volumes and user traffic. The client needed a scalable, cloud-native solution that could process millions of analytics events per day while maintaining fast response times.

We designed a microservices architecture with distinct services for data ingestion, processing, storage, and API access. The API layer uses GraphQL to provide flexible querying capabilities, while Redis caching dramatically improves performance for frequently-accessed data.

The entire infrastructure runs on AWS using containerized services with Docker and Kubernetes. We implemented auto-scaling policies that automatically adjust resources based on traffic patterns, ensuring cost efficiency during quiet periods and reliability during traffic spikes.
