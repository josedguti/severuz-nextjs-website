## Overview

Contract Guard was designed to democratize access to legal expertise by leveraging artificial intelligence to analyze complex legal documents. Users can upload contracts, agreements, and legal documents in multiple formats (PDF, Word, or even images), and receive instant, comprehensive analysis.

We built a sophisticated document processing pipeline that extracts text from various file formats, applies advanced natural language processing and AI models to understand legal terminology and context, and generates detailed risk assessments. The platform identifies potential issues, unfavorable terms, missing clauses, and compliance concerns.
